This code is designed to scale and register two pose graphs that are related by
a constant transform, such as the trajectory of two sensors mounted ot the same
rigid body.  This code estimates the scaled transform that aligns the two
trajectories.

The key function is "RegisterSensors( camposes, armposes )"

As an example see RegisterCam2Arm.m.

To produce camera poses use vicalib:
GLOG_logtostderr=1  ./vicalib  -cam file://./image* -grid_preset=letter -exit_vicalib_on_finish=false -save_poses=true -model_files=cameras.xml -calibrate_intrinsics=false

where cameras.xml is the already calibrated camera model.
